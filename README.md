This will gather all <p> tags from a specified page and return a list of paragraphs in string form. It is intended to be used with the Latin Library, but should scrape from any page whatsover.

Usage:

<paragraphs> = make_text(<source>)

Where <paragraphs> is a variable name of your choosing;
and <source> is a url of a page whose <p> strings you want.
