This will gather all paragraph tags from a specified page and return a list of paragraphs in string form. It is intended to be used with the Latin Library, but should scrape from any page whatsover.

Usage:

&lt;paragraphs&gt; = make_text(&lt;source&gt;)

Where &lt;paragraphs&gt; is a variable name of your choosing;
and &lt;source&gt; is a url of a page whose &lt;p&gt; strings you want.
